# Tweets Application analysis

## Overview

In this project, we created an application to retrieve, process, view and analyze tweets about a subject identified by the user.
This project is composed of two parts:
* A script to execute a request on the twitter API. The script allows you to retrieve tweets through the Twitter API. The tweets are then processed using Natural Language Processing techniques.
* A second script to deploy a Dash application to visualize and analyze the data collected.
